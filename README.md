Following is the top-level directory layout of the repository -

.
├── frontend                   # Templates for frontend technologies
├── backend                  # Templates for backend technologies
├── devops                    # Templates for devops tools
├── mobile                     # Templates for mobile technologies
├── full-stack                 # Templates for combination of frontend and backend technologies
├── LICENSE
└── README.md

Each folder contains multiple sub-folders which contains the template 

To directly pull any template to local machine, paste the following command in the terminal -

```
svn checkout https://github.com/harsh-2711/getting-started/trunk/<domain>/<technology>
```

Replace `domain` with the top-level directory name i.e. frontend, backend, etc. and `technology` with the concerned language for which you need boilerplate code i.e. react, node, etc.
