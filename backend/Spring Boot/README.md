## 📌 Introduction
Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a Micro Service. Developing Services with spring Boot is too cool.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

## 📌Deep dive with Spring Boot
To start working with Spring Boot, we will require to do basic installations.

[Installing Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)<br>
[Installing IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html)

Checkout starter project and you will be ready to implement Spring Boot as your backend technology to create Services.<br>

In this folder, you will find all the getting-started resources about Spring Boot and Spring Boot Starter Projects. Basic REST Services will be made available to this folder.

## 📌 Goal
Provide quick start for projects with flavour of Spring Boot.<br>
Provide a range of features that are common to large classes of projects.

## 📌 Prerequisite to use Spring Boot
You should know Java. You should understand the usage of Annotations. You can learn more about Annotations from [here](https://springframework.guru/spring-framework-annotations/)<br>
You should understand the basics of Spring framework.<br>
