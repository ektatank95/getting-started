##  Introduction
-   This project contains template with basic structure for Spring Boot.
-   Project is build with` maven` build tool. It can be easily upgraded to `gradle` if required.
-   The template contains default configration of spring boot and servlet container. These configurations can be modified  using  `application.properties` file is present in project structure.
-   The template is provided with basic Health Check Api to check if the project is deployed and working correctly.
-   Demo test Case for Health Check Api is also included in the template. This can help to create test cases for other features.
-   Spring Boot Starter Project also includes implementation of simple CRUD operations with a `USER` entity.
-   API flow is  `Controller -> Service -> Repository`.
-   User request will hit on backend  `Controller`.
-   `Service` class contains implementation of API provided in  `Controller`.

## Creating Spring Boot Starter Project
-   [Using Spring.io initializer](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2018/02/create-spring-boot-project-spring-initializer.html)
-   [Using IntelliJ or any similar IDE and Maven simple project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/spring-boot.html)
-   [Using Spring Tool Suite](https://www.javatpoint.com/creating-spring-boot-project-using-sts)
-   [Using CLI](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/springbootcli/springbootcli_creating_project.htm)

##  Creating Spring Boot Application
-    Spring Boot creates ```Stane-ALone``` Application. It means it is not required to install Tomcat Sever on your own (Perks of using Spring Boot ðŸ˜‰). Learn more about this feature from [here](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-spring-boot#:~:text=Being%20Standalone,applications%20that%20you%20can%20run.&text=You%20may%20think%20that%20running,run%20command%20and%20everything%20works.).<br>
-   Default Port to run an application is 8080. We can change the port of application in the `application.properties` file. Check the `application.properties` file to check port configuration changed by me.Check more details for `application.properties`  from  [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-boot-properties).

## Database configuration 
-   Create a PostgreSQL database with the name  `SPRINGBOOT_STARTER` and add the credentials to `application.properties`. <br/>

-   The default credentials and driver followed for this project :<br/>
    ```spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:6001/SPRINGBOOT_STARTER
    spring.datasource.username=postgres
    spring.datasource.password=root
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true

-   You can change database from postgreSQL to MySQL/Oracle by just changing these properties mentioned in `application.properties`. <br/>
